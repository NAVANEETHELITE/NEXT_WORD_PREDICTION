# NEXT_WORD_PREDICTION
- Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features.
- Google uses next word prediction based on our browsing history.
- So a preloaded data will be stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly.
- I have used an LSTM model, trained upto 40 epochs and gave an accuracy of 69%.
